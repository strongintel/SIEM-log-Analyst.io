## Project Overview

This project involves setting up a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution, ingesting logs from various sources, and analyzing them to detect security threats. The primary objectives include:

- **Configuring a SIEM Tool:** Set up a SIEM solution for effective log management and monitoring.
- **Data Ingestion:** Collect logs from multiple sources, such as Windows event logs and firewall logs, using tools like Splunk Universal Forwarder or Filebeat.
- **Dashboard Creation:** Develop dashboards to monitor key security metrics and visualize data trends.
- **Alert Implementation:** Set up alerts to identify potential security incidents, such as multiple failed login attempts or suspicious IP addresses.
- **Log Analysis:** Analyze log data to uncover anomalies and potential threats, applying search queries and filters.
- **Incident Response:** Document findings and responses to any detected incidents.

This project aims to demonstrate skills in log analysis, threat detection, and incident response, providing hands-on experience in a critical area of cybersecurity.
